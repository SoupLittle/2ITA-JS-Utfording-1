# 2ITA-JS-Utfording-1

Welcome to the 2ITA-JS-Utfording-1 repository! 

In this project, I created a simple web page that features an automatic text writer and a dynamic moving background.

You can see the project by visiting the [2ITA-JS-Utfording-1 Demo](https://souplittle.github.io/2ITA-JS-Utfording-1/).

## Features

### 1. Automatic Text Writer

The automatic text writer is implemented using JavaScript and the Typed.js library. It types out a predefined set of words in a loop, creating an engaging and visually appealing effect.

### 2. Moving Background

The moving background is created using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It features a particle animation that responds to user interaction (clicks). The particles move in a dynamic and randomized pattern, creating a visually interesting background.


## Resources

Here are some websites and resources that were instrumental in the development of this project:

- [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbGSsy17Ass)
  - The basis code I've used for this project.
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/supah/pen/ExabJxB)
  - The basis code for the moving background
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_typewriter.asp)
  - The original youtube tutorial code did not work with the moving background so i used this code as a base and made a new code that worked with the moving background

  - For when I had pieces of code that wouldn't work, no matter how much I triedðŸ˜­
